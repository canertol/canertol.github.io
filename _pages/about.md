Hello!ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from [Vernam Lab](https://vernamlab.org/), [WPI](https://wpi.edu/), advised by [Berk Sunar](https://sunar.org/).

My current research interests are
 - Microarchitectural (_Î¼arch_) security
 - Side-channel and Fault Injection attacks
 - Attacks on ML models and other critical software
 - Automated detection and patching of _Î¼arch_ vulnerabilities using AI

Outside of work, I do [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), scuba diving, sailing, tango...
